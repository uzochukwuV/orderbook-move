# **Interest-Free P2P Lending Protocol**

## **Overview**

This is a decentralized protocol built on the **Umi** blockchain, offering **interest-free loans** backed by collateral. Inspired by the **Liquity** protocol, our goal is to provide a stable and decentralized way for users to borrow funds without the burden of interest rates, using a **collateralized debt position (CDP)** model.

### **Problem Statement**

Traditional lending often involves high interest rates, adding significant financial strain on borrowers. This protocol aims to provide a better alternative by offering **interest-free loans** while maintaining protocol stability through a **collateralized** mechanism.

## **How It Works**

The protocol enables users to **borrow stablecoins** without paying interest by locking collateral. The loan is secured by the collateral, and if the value of the collateral falls below a set threshold, it can be liquidated to repay the loan. This ensures that the protocol remains solvent without charging interest to borrowers.

### **Core Features**

- **Interest-Free Loans**: Loans are offered without interest, relying on collateral to secure the loan value.
- **Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs)**: Users lock collateral to take out loans. The collateral value must exceed the loan amount by a predetermined ratio (e.g., 110%).
- **Liquidation Mechanism**: If the collateral value drops below the required threshold, it is liquidated to repay the loan.
- **Stability Pool**: A reserve pool that absorbs liquidated collateral to maintain the protocol's stability.

## **How to Use**

### **For Borrowers**

1. Deposit collateral (e.g., ETH) to secure a loan.
2. Specify the amount you wish to borrow (in stablecoins).
3. Borrow funds at no interest, ensuring your collateral remains above the required ratio.
4. Repay the loan when ready to unlock your collateral.

### **For Lenders**

1. Provide collateral to the **Stability Pool**.
2. Earn rewards through **liquidation fees** or other incentives for participating in the protocol.
3. Help maintain protocol stability by absorbing collateral when borrowers fail to maintain collateral ratios.

## **Future Improvements**

- **Governance**: Introduce decentralized governance to allow users to vote on protocol changes (e.g., adjusting collateral ratios).
- **Interest-free Loan Modifications**: Implement more advanced mechanisms to reduce liquidation risks, such as multiple collateral types or a dynamic collateral ratio.
- **Collateralized Token**: Introduce a new collateral-backed token for additional stability.
